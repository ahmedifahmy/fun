1
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,093
He's in the other room.

2
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:28,698
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

3
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,573
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

4
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,936
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.

5
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:40,813
- It's a coded message.
- It's a Playfair cipher.

6
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:44,816
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

7
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:47,379
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

8
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:51,621
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.

9
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,062
I believe what you need is right there.

10
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:57,123
It'll take some time.

11
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:03,196
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.

12
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:10,308
- Whoa.

13
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:28,893
...calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark

14
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,230
in about most things
as well as shootin'.

15
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,107
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.

16
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:46,416
I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots

17
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,051
till I am quite sure of the American.

18
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:53,886
- Ah, that's my own girl.

19
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:55,857
Augusta, dear, to your room.

20
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:04,298
...to turn you inside out, old
gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.

21
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,975
Sic semper tyrannis!

22
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,157
Temples.

23
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,026
Gold.

24
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,567
Cibola? This is a treasure map.

25
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:46,399
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

26
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,501
You're all traitors.

27
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:54,281
- President Lincoln's been shot!
- Everybody, out! All of you!

28
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,285
Killer's on the loose!

29
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:02,782
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.

30
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,730
- Dad!
- The war is over.

31
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,097
No!

32
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,972
- No!
- No!

33
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:28,045
You're wrong about that.

34
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,751
The war has only just begun!

35
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,928
Charles.
The debt that all men... men pay.

36
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:42,794
The debt that all men p...

37
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,158
Dad! No, please!

38
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:54,504
Come back. It's not fair.

39
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,774
Help! Somebody help, please!

40
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:01,273
So recapping:

41
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:05,378
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

42
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,583
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

43
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:13,220
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

44
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,231
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

45
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:19,234
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

46
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,668
- Thank you.

47
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,905
I'd like
to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

48
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:27,966
Thank you.

49
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:34,313
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

50
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:35,373
Thank you.

51
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,851
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather

52
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,153
had been here to see this wonderful day.

53
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,750
Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.

54
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,626
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

55
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:50,598
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

56
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,100
Perhaps.

57
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:55,829
- Perhaps not.

58
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:59,672
You see, I have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,

59
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,542
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

60
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,538
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

61
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,579
As Silas tells it,

62
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:13,885
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

63
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,751
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

64
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:19,728
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

65
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,287
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

66
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,534
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

67
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:31,730
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

68
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,507
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

69
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:43,110
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

70
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:46,383
He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis"
after he shot Lincoln.

71
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,983
- "Thus always to..."
- "Thus always to tyrants" We know.

72
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:54,687
- "Surratt, copiae"?
- Military supplies.

73
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:57,096
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

74
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,067
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

75
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:08,105
- "Thomas Gates, artifex"
- "Designer"

76
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,545
- or "mastermind"
- I know what it means.

77
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,879
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

78
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:18,944
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

79
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,650
You see that?
Burned out right there.

80
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:26,328
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

81
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:29,194
- May l, Mr...?
- Wilkinson.

82
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,962
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

83
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,198
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

84
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:38,833
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

85
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:42,106
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

86
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:44,544
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

87
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:48,050
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

88
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:03,921
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

89
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:05,967
It can't be.

90
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:09,168
Maps to presidents' houses.

91
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,740
Keys to locks that don't exist.

92
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:16,935
What's the point?
What am I looking for?

93
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,478
Proof, proof, proof.

94
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,316
What proof?

95
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,598
Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

96
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:52,205
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

97
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,776
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

98
00:08:56,853 --> 00:09:00,311
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.

99
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,785
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...

100
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:05,555
There's a picture of me right there.

101
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:09,355
I think it's a pretty good picture.

102
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,731
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

103
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,670
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.

104
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,800
- Oh, I've never heard of you.
- Oh!

105
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:27,578
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

106
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:32,480
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

107
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,718
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.

108
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:38,988
Hm?

109
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,367
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

110
00:09:58,314 --> 00:09:59,542
Where's the Ferrari?

111
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:03,944
- lRS impounded it.
- The lRS?

112
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,616
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

113
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,886
on an island that didn't exist

114
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,986
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

115
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:18,694
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

116
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,661
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

117
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:25,037
Six million dollars.

118
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,903
But enough about me.

119
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,343
What's new with you?

120
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:35,282
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,

121
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:38,479
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

122
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,390
I need your help.

123
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:44,684
I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

124
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:48,458
I need to get Abigail's lD.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

125
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,658
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

126
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,134
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

127
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,262
All right.

128
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:59,798
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

129
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:03,277
- Go.

130
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:12,077
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

131
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:15,921
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.

132
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,391
"So?"

133
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,520
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter"

134
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,499
"So, you seem to always know what's best"
"So, I guess I'm invisible"

135
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,331
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

136
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:29,200
- Oh.

137
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:33,800
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

138
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:35,905
You did that in 25 seconds.

139
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,470
That's why I tell people to get a dog.

140
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,046
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

141
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,151
That's not Abigail's car.

142
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,198
She was on a date.

143
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:59,758
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

144
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:03,566
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

145
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,595
He's weird!

146
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:07,336
What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?

147
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,140
Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

148
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,475
Pretty much.

149
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:14,073
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

150
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,176
All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

151
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:19,778
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

152
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,585
Oh, Abigail.

153
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,390
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.

154
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:28,862
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

155
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:31,156
How did you get in, Ben?

156
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:36,770
Riley! Come out here!

157
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,834
What?

158
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:47,045
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

159
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,142
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance...?

160
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,246
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

161
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:56,317
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

162
00:12:56,392 --> 00:13:00,954
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

163
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,697
What?

164
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:05,359
Um, maybe I should go.

165
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:09,064
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

166
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:12,367
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

167
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,704
You do?

168
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,641
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

169
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,808
- Awkward.
- Oh, great.

170
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,012
- Good night.
- Good night.

171
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:27,287
I cannot believe you broke in.

172
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,951
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

173
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:32,721
Hand it over, Ben.

174
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,355
I need to see
the Booth diary page.

175
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:39,231
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

176
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:43,102
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

177
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,471
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

178
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,737
It could have been erased or faded.

179
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:52,269
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

180
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,339
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

181
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,942
That department reports
to your department.

182
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,317
Come on. One look under infrared.

183
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:01,346
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

184
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:08,493
Both of them?

185
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,601
We've been looking
at this page for hours.

186
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:16,263
There's nothing there.

187
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:21,543
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

188
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,045
ln a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

189
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,412
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

190
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:31,647
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

191
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,745
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

192
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:38,760
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

193
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:42,491
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

194
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:46,228
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

195
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,100
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

196
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:53,939
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And l
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

197
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:58,075
- Ben.
- What?

198
00:14:58,181 --> 00:14:59,546
Look at this.

199
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:03,308
- See that?
- Oh.

200
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:08,153
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge"

201
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,356
It's nothing.

202
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:16,096
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

203
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,597
The letters are backwards.

204
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,659
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

205
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:23,035
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

206
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:28,874
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

207
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:33,348
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

208
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,646
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

209
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,016
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

210
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,851
- All right.
- Uh, can I get a printout of this?

211
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,824
There's a billion words
in the English language.

212
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:46,953
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

213
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,587
A. Aardvark.

214
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:52,657
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop

215
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:56,694
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

216
00:15:56,773 --> 00:16:01,574
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

217
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,606
What if he isn't innocent?

218
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:18,953
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

219
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,155
What did he find now? Atlantis?

220
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,926
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

221
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,059
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

222
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:28,228
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators

223
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:32,331
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

224
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,037
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather

225
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:38,706
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates"

226
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,683
- Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

227
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,950
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

228
00:16:47,023 --> 00:16:50,356
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

229
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,694
- Why?
- We'll find out.

230
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,264
Better.

231
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,060
Better.

232
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,230
Bacon.

233
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,099
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

234
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:11,370
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

235
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,980
We're grateful
to the Wilkinson family

236
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,747
for coming forth with the page.

237
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,689
On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.

238
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:26,285
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

239
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,795
It's on the internet!

240
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,069
- No stopping it now.
- Gates may have been the architect...

241
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,734
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

242
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,106
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

243
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:45,546
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

244
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,446
We have a story. We have nothing.

245
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:51,044
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

246
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,180
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

247
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:57,484
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

248
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:02,155
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. history.

249
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:04,792
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

250
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,968
You and I both know he burned the page

251
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:10,528
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

252
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,403
That's what we're going to prove.

253
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,966
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

254
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:18,411
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

255
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:21,177
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

256
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,812
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map"

257
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:29,949
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

258
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,587
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

259
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:36,488
- Wait a minute.
- What?

260
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,763
He took his son's hand.

261
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:45,933
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

262
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:50,877
- "The debt that all men pay"
- "The debt that all men pay"?

263
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:53,074
The debt that Thomas paid.

264
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,481
That's five letters.

265
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,075
Oh!

266
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:58,312
Try "Death"

267
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,117
- What?
- It's the key code.

268
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,020
The debt that all men pay is death.

269
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:07,820
All right.

270
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:12,732
L-A-B-O-U-I...

271
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,370
It's Lab-ool...

272
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:19,636
Lab-ahl... La...

273
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:20,869
It's gibberish.

274
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:23,173
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

275
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,873
- What is that?
- It's a who. douard Laboulaye.

276
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:26,972
Where's the phone?

277
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,745
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

278
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,812
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.

279
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,088
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.

280
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,321
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

281
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,694
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

282
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,329
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

283
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:52,204
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

284
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,504
- Any news?
- Well...

285
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:58,911
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

286
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,541
Take a look.

287
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:06,119
Random letters. A cipher?

288
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:07,815
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

289
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,949
He's the one that discovered it.

290
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,561
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

291
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,660
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

292
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:19,928
Hey. What?

293
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:22,470
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye"

294
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,267
The cipher spells "Laboulaye. "

295
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,367
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.

296
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:32,141
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

297
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:35,445
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

298
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,679
L-A-D, lad... ladder...

299
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,414
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

300
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,888
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

301
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,992
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

302
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:48,690
right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?

303
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,891
OK, Ben, I've got to go.

304
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:53,434
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

305
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,932
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

306
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,701
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.

307
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,946
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.

308
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,074
Laboulaye? As in douard Laboulaye?

309
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,744
He seems to believe so, yes.

310
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,220
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

311
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:16,520
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

312
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:20,494
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

313
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:22,428
Did you learn that from my book?

314
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:28,096
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

315
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,639
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

316
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,006
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

317
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:39,275
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

318
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:44,513
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

319
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:47,750
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

320
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:48,915
Exactly.

321
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,290
Is there more than one?

322
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:54,919
There are three, actually, Riley.

323
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:59,434
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

324
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,003
But he only referred to one
as his "lady"

325
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,334
But he only referred to one
as his "lady"

326
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:21,885
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

327
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:23,584
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

328
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,686
Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

329
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,596
Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.

330
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,066
No. Believe me, I understand.

331
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,831
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?

332
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:42,175
Ah, American, eh?

333
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,801
Of course you see no problem

334
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:47,110
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning

335
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:49,549
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!

336
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,918
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

337
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:55,718
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

338
00:22:58,093 --> 00:23:01,324
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that..."

339
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:04,491
"...no man need
be afraid of another"

340
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:06,796
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

341
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,628
- I'm astonished.
- I got it, I got it.

342
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,771
- I hope you read French.
- May l?

343
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,077
He's a cop.

344
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:22,914
Um... "Across the sea
these twins stand determined..."

345
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,453
- Resolute.
- "Resolute" yeah.

346
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,422
"...to preserve what we are looking for.

347
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,392
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1876"
- Six.

348
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:35,988
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute"

349
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,994
Let's see. Resolute twins.

350
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:42,002
Resolute.

351
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,604
Resolute. And then twins.

352
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:51,312
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

353
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,949
That's ridiculous.
HMS Resolute.

354
00:23:55,885 --> 00:24:00,345
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.

355
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:05,393
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

356
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:07,918
When the ship was finally retired,

357
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:12,957
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

358
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,435
Voil. Resolute twins.

359
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:19,838
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

360
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,207
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

361
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:24,838
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

362
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,940
He's going to call you a cab.

363
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:30,542
- OK?

364
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:34,282
- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.

365
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:38,452
- OK, so you get the ticket.
- Great.

366
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,523
Mitch Wilkinson studied history
at Virginia Military lnstitute.

367
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:46,466
Graduated 1978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in lraq

368
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:49,333
during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.

369
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:53,671
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

370
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:57,273
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

371
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:01,610
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?

372
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:05,916
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?

373
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,319
So the queen's office is here.

374
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,480
The elevator shaft gets you close,

375
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:17,389
but the only direct access
is through security.

376
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:20,917
- That should be exciting.
- We got to get you in that room.

377
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:23,997
- Hi, Dad.
- Ben.

378
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,626
It's Patrick Gates' phone.
He's calling Ben.

379
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:27,760
Give me that.

380
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:31,504
The house was broken into
last night. I was attacked.

381
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,097
Call the police. I'm coming home.

382
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,006
- What?
- What good would that do?

383
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:38,171
They didn't take anything.
And besides, I'm fine.

384
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:41,705
OK. We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.

385
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:44,947
We have an appointment
with the curator tomorrow afternoon.

386
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,250
- Son, just be careful. Goodbye.
- Bye.

387
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,187
Someone else is after the treasure.

388
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:51,658
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.

389
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:55,595
- It's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.

390
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:57,859
We don't want to miss that appointment.

391
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,129
- Hi. Ben Gates.
- See security. They'll let you in.

392
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:20,277
Wow.

393
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:46,107
OK. It's teatime, chaps.

394
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:03,190
Looking for the curator's office.
Which way was it again?

395
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,733
Follow the stairs round,
then turn first left.

396
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:07,428
Thank you so much.

397
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,605
- Ben.
- Abigail.

398
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,906
- What's she doing here?
- What're you doing?

399
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:20,073
Your dad called me.
Said your next clue was here.

400
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:22,083
- She's really there?
- Ben...

401
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:23,618
- drop her. Lose her.
- I want to help.

402
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:26,449
That's very nice,
but it's a bad time right now.

403
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:30,219
- A bad time, right now?
- It's a bad time.

404
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:34,922
OK, I just flew all the way
to London to offer my help...

405
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:37,397
- Remember the plan.
- You don't need it?

406
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:39,228
You're the one making a scene.

407
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,737
- I... I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.

408
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,433
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!

409
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:50,708
- So subtle.
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.

410
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,646
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!

411
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:56,650
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

412
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:59,312
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

413
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:01,412
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.

414
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:05,358
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

415
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:08,919
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?

416
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,865
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly

417
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:14,300
doesn't make it wrong.

418
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,066
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

419
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,835
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

420
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,899
You and your missus, take it outside.

421
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:26,038
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

422
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:29,083
You take the missus outside.
I'm staying right here.

423
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,685
- Ben!
- Whee!

424
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,482
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello.

425
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:36,023
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

426
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,117
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

427
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,162
Going to arrest a man for that?

428
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,666
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

429
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:46,325
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

430
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,028
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

431
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:49,127
- Sir!
- Haggis!

432
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:53,072
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

433
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,234
Here they are, standing in a row!

434
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,370
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

435
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,938
That was brilliant.

436
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,384
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

437
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:08,514
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.

438
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,717
Hoo! So I'm wrong again.

439
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,893
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

440
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:18,194
- Your mother told me about you.

441
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:23,729
- ln here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

442
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:26,968
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

443
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:29,941
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

444
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,980
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

445
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:35,312
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

446
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,350
What is going on?

447
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:41,355
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

448
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,517
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

449
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,323
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was

450
00:30:47,396 --> 00:30:50,058
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

451
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:53,067
Where "I assume I'm right"
Get us out. Which I don't get.

452
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:56,070
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.

453
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:58,572
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

454
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:01,666
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

455
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:04,769
I get lucky a lot.

456
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:07,374
So where does that leave me, Ben?

457
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,679
You guys are so great together.

458
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,651
- Want to know why I'm here?
- Uh-huh.

459
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:17,090
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

460
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,326
Does that help?

461
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:24,855
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

462
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:28,460
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

463
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:31,097
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

464
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:34,574
- door number one, opening.

465
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,738
OK. Let me try this out.

466
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:42,909
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

467
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,747
Yes. Thank you.

468
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,447
Ridiculous. You're staying.

469
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:48,455
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

470
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:51,083
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

471
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:54,092
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

472
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:57,688
You should be near
a service elevator.

473
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,994
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

474
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:04,062
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

475
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,664
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

476
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:09,342
- No.
- Don't let her go.

477
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:10,844
- Abigail...

478
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,938
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

479
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:16,879
Hold this.

480
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:25,356
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

481
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:26,485
Yeah.

482
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:36,264
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

483
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:38,128
So?

484
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:40,969
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

485
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,973
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

486
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,717
Let's go.

487
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,350
OK, now turn left.

488
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,955
- Dead end.
- I mean right. Go right.

489
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:09,368
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

490
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:18,710
Go, go.

491
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,081
That's it.

492
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:26,680
The Resolute desk.

493
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:29,154
We're looking for...

494
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:35,059
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

495
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:39,932
Hey, look at this.

496
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:48,137
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880"
- Hold on one second.

497
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:53,370
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

498
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,542
He made Chinese puzzle boxes.

499
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,983
- Oh...
- What?

500
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:11,657
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

501
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:15,260
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

502
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,296
What about a year?

503
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:22,105
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

504
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,008
So you go one...

505
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:27,937
Eight.

506
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,012
One.

507
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,217
Nine.

508
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:44,759
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

509
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,165
on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.

510
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:48,691
One.

511
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,267
Eight.

512
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,572
Seven.

513
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,680
Six.

514
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:30,400
Uh-oh.

515
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:32,206
New rules.

516
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:36,346
These markings, like lncan or Aztec.

517
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:38,648
I have never seen any symbols like this.

518
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,090
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

519
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,558
What do you think it means?

520
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:49,154
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

521
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,960
Uh-oh.

522
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:55,332
Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.

523
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:05,208
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

524
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:11,217
The fire alarm's gone off.

525
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:13,345
Uh-oh. God save the queen.

526
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,323
All units, go to action zebra.

527
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,484
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.

528
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:24,657
Someone or something is causing this.

529
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:27,998
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

530
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:31,334
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

531
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:51,318
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

532
00:36:51,393 --> 00:36:55,022
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

533
00:36:55,096 --> 00:37:00,432
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.

534
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:21,416
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.

535
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,047
I'm a little bit allergic.

536
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,285
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.

537
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,693
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!

538
00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:32,326
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?

539
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,234
Daniel, hold it.

540
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,070
What is that?

541
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,836
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

542
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,572
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

543
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:46,875
It's an incredible discovery.

544
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:51,951
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!

545
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:56,516
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.

546
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,287
We're in England.

547
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:09,667
It's a gun! Get down!

548
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,237
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

549
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:28,781
Hey, who are you?

550
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:45,898
Sorry.

551
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,140
- Hey!
- Oi!

552
00:38:57,385 --> 00:39:00,616
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?

553
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,891
Whoa!

554
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,520
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.

555
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,900
Turn, turn!

556
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:18,895
Watch out!

557
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:26,639
Everybody OK?

558
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,980
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.

559
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:40,720
Look out!

560
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:42,485
Ah!

561
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:52,232
Ah!

562
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:15,760
Go. Go, go, go, go!

563
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,923
Did you see where he went?

564
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:27,670
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.

565
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:30,973
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

566
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:33,240
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

567
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:36,340
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

568
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,714
Tell that to my father.

569
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:43,514
- Moron!

570
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:46,082
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

571
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:51,331
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

572
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:57,071
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

573
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:01,541
- Get out of the way!

574
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:06,912
- Did I just run over a man's foot?
- Watch the people!

575
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,183
Go! Go! Faster!

576
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,669
- Right over there.
- I got them.

577
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,805
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

578
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:39,369
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

579
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:45,576
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

580
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,814
- Ah! Ah!

581
00:41:56,297 --> 00:42:00,256
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

582
00:42:00,368 --> 00:42:02,996
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?

583
00:42:03,037 --> 00:42:05,904
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.

584
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:08,534
Why, thank you, Riley.

585
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,758
Get it!

586
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:37,131
Stop! Stop!

587
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,024
- He's got it.
- What is it?

588
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:00,595
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

589
00:43:00,595 --> 00:43:02,495
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

590
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:13,734
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

591
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:16,900
Nice to see you two together again.

592
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:19,173
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

593
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:22,705
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

594
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:35,887
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

595
00:43:35,963 --> 00:43:39,455
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

596
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,935
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

597
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,707
I can identify one symbol.

598
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,838
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

599
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:54,882
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

600
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,909
That symbol is Cibola.

601
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,845
That's Cibola.

602
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:03,255
The City of Gold.

603
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:05,120
The City of Gold.

604
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:12,123
"ln 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

605
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,065
There were only four survivors.

606
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:19,129
One was a slave named Estebn
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

607
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:22,040
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

608
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,010
a city built from solid gold.

609
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,041
Later, when Estebn tried to find
the city again, he never could.

610
00:44:30,118 --> 00:44:35,750
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

611
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:40,650
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

612
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:45,165
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it"

613
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:55,538
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

614
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,744
My God.

615
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,271
I'm going to go talk to her.

616
00:45:04,152 --> 00:45:06,552
- You're coming with me.
- No!

617
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:10,887
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

618
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,323
There are several others.

619
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:14,725
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

620
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,787
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

621
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:21,062
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

622
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:23,965
That long?

623
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:28,402
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

624
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:31,172
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

625
00:45:31,846 --> 00:45:35,680
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

626
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,150
- Who?
- His mom.

627
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:45,252
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

628
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:49,092
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

629
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:51,330
I hate her!

630
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,858
We're in the right place.

631
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,168
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

632
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:03,073
- Hi, Mom.
- Benjamin!

633
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:06,307
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

634
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,369
Hi.

635
00:46:08,616 --> 00:46:09,605
Oh.

636
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:14,811
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

637
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:16,754
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

638
00:46:16,824 --> 00:46:19,691
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

639
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,752
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

640
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,799
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

641
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,996
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

642
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:33,165
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

643
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:36,438
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

644
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,877
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

645
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:43,007
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

646
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:45,177
You thought it had secret stitching.

647
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:47,687
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

648
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:51,122
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

649
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:55,418
I need you to take a look at this.

650
00:46:56,597 --> 00:46:59,122
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

651
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,724
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

652
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:05,529
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

653
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:08,769
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

654
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,102
Yes, of course you were.

655
00:47:13,948 --> 00:47:17,281
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

656
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:20,149
Mom, this is actually very important.

657
00:47:22,123 --> 00:47:24,557
All right. What have we got here?

658
00:47:25,293 --> 00:47:29,992
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird". And that means...

659
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,062
Uh, "noble bird"

660
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:40,335
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

661
00:47:40,408 --> 00:47:43,673
and give you passage
to the sacred temple"

662
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:53,547
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cibola, don't you?

663
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:55,953
Well, that is exactly what it is.

664
00:47:56,023 --> 00:48:00,153
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cibola"
It means "the center of the world"

665
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:04,129
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

666
00:48:04,165 --> 00:48:07,896
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

667
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,765
- Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

668
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:13,364
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

669
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:15,602
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

670
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:17,974
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

671
00:48:18,045 --> 00:48:22,948
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

672
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:27,247
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

673
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:32,153
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

674
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:34,556
I'm sorry.

675
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:36,830
Not that I'm surprised.

676
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:41,390
At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

677
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:43,367
What?

678
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:46,203
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:48,935
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

680
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:55,514
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

681
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,073
So where is it?

682
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,780
lnscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute"

683
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:05,349
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

684
00:49:05,426 --> 00:49:08,953
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

685
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,929
President's desk?

686
00:49:11,565 --> 00:49:13,328
The president. What president?

687
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:16,336
- Our President?
- Unfortunately, yes.

688
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:17,928
But that means...

689
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:19,336
Wait, so we have to...

690
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:21,801
The White House?

691
00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:26,671
The Oval Office... to be exact.

692
00:49:29,283 --> 00:49:31,080
Why would I overreact to that?

693
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:39,590
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

694
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,718
Thank you.

695
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,658
It's early, pre-Columbian.

696
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,000
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

697
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,370
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

698
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:57,240
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

699
00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:58,710
Where are we to find them?

700
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,780
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

701
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:03,839
What do you mean?

702
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,146
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

703
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:11,392
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

704
00:50:11,392 --> 00:50:14,327
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

705
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:19,065
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

706
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:21,328
Look at this. Look.

707
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:23,267
Small door on the front of the desk.

708
00:50:23,337 --> 00:50:26,795
FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

709
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:29,775
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

710
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,045
This could work.

711
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,844
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

712
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:39,379
I think you're right.

713
00:50:41,355 --> 00:50:45,917
We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.

714
00:50:45,993 --> 00:50:50,089
Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.

715
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:55,126
- That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

716
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:58,330
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

717
00:50:58,439 --> 00:51:00,066
Yeah, I love it.

718
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:05,807
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

719
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,246
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

720
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,476
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

721
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:13,987
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

722
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:16,420
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

723
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,459
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

724
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:22,655
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

725
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,131
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

726
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,727
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

727
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:32,772
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

728
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,003
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

729
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:39,045
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

730
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,241
What is going on
with the education in America?

731
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:46,286
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

732
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,821
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

733
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:51,449
- ...with Gates.
- Connor.

734
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,584
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

735
00:51:57,565 --> 00:51:59,157
Aren't you going to ask him?

736
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:00,723
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

737
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,929
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

738
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:09,137
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

739
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,337
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

740
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:16,281
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

741
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,480
- I can do that.
- Really?

742
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,542
You see?

743
00:52:21,188 --> 00:52:22,519
- You can?
- Yeah.

744
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:26,890
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

745
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:28,622
Connor rocks.

746
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:32,322
Well... here we are.

747
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,765
- Mm.
- Wow.

748
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:39,468
Empire furnishings
and crenellated molding. Love it.

749
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,371
Hm.

750
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:44,343
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

751
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,403
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

752
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:48,607
Oh. Sorry.

753
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,880
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

754
00:52:55,556 --> 00:52:58,616
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

755
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:01,286
playing underneath
while his father was working.

756
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:03,228
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

757
00:53:03,297 --> 00:53:06,198
But many people don't know

758
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,724
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

759
00:53:09,803 --> 00:53:11,828
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

760
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:14,169
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

761
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,176
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

762
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:18,711
And Ford, of course.

763
00:53:18,846 --> 00:53:21,280
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

764
00:53:21,348 --> 00:53:23,373
- No.
- Yes.

765
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,180
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

766
00:53:27,054 --> 00:53:29,887
Oh! I... I did, yes.

767
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:33,222
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

768
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:37,093
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

769
00:53:37,164 --> 00:53:40,099
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

770
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,532
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

771
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:43,900
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

772
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,202
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

773
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:48,605
and check it out?

774
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:52,311
I'll check over here.

775
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:03,848
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

776
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:13,900
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

777
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:23,636
Oh, no.

778
00:54:28,982 --> 00:54:32,816
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

779
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,853
Connor!

780
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:44,091
- You found it.
- I did.

781
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:55,998
Thank you so much!

782
00:54:56,443 --> 00:54:57,910
Uh...

783
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:01,544
You're just the best. Mm.

784
00:55:05,586 --> 00:55:06,678
Mm!

785
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:13,590
Mm!

786
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,656
Mm!

787
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:21,494
Thank you.

788
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:24,905
OK.

789
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:25,735
OK.

790
00:55:28,308 --> 00:55:30,572
- Empty.
- Someone must've taken it.

791
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:34,239
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

792
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:36,441
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

793
00:55:36,517 --> 00:55:40,009
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The Presidential Seal.

794
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,987
It's not the Presidential Seal.

795
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:45,718
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

796
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:48,694
- I'm not sure what this is.
- What do we do?

797
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,354
Did none of you read my book?

798
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,530
The eagle clutching the scroll.

799
00:55:54,902 --> 00:55:56,699
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

800
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,897
But it's not something I could tell you.

801
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:03,909
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

802
00:56:10,217 --> 00:56:13,914
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

803
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:15,545
Chapter 13.

804
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,626
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book"

805
00:56:24,698 --> 00:56:28,862
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

806
00:56:28,936 --> 00:56:32,337
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

807
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:36,140
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

808
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:40,647
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

809
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:45,444
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

810
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:49,478
And the coup de grce... Area 51.

811
00:56:49,556 --> 00:56:52,684
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

812
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:55,694
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

813
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,924
It's just totally...

814
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,259
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

815
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:04,100
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

816
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:07,334
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

817
00:57:08,942 --> 00:57:09,966
Same symbol.

818
00:57:10,043 --> 00:57:13,444
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of lnformation Act.

819
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,242
The eagle and the scroll,

820
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:19,581
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

821
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:22,451
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

822
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,423
is now in the President's Secret Book?

823
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:29,127
Ben.

824
00:57:29,796 --> 00:57:31,889
If it was you trying to convince me...

825
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,394
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

826
00:57:41,108 --> 00:57:42,837
The eagle with the scroll?

827
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,612
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

828
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:50,548
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

829
00:57:50,617 --> 00:57:52,209
You bought Riley's book.

830
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:55,687
Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

831
00:57:55,756 --> 00:57:58,224
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

832
00:57:58,325 --> 00:58:00,725
Does the President have a secret book?

833
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:08,896
Do you like ducks?

834
00:58:12,372 --> 00:58:13,566
There is a book.

835
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:16,905
Why are you telling me out here?

836
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,546
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

837
00:58:20,614 --> 00:58:22,878
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

838
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:27,353
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

839
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,015
The book is passed
from president to president,

840
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,354
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

841
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,451
You're the FBl.
Can't you get it for me?

842
00:58:34,528 --> 00:58:38,089
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

843
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:40,531
Well, you never know.

844
00:58:42,402 --> 00:58:44,632
All I need is a few minutes with him.

845
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:47,302
A few minutes? Really?

846
00:58:47,374 --> 00:58:49,604
Even if you were married
to the President,

847
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:51,940
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

848
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:55,004
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

849
00:58:55,082 --> 00:58:57,380
How do you expect
to get the President alone?

850
00:58:57,484 --> 00:59:00,578
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

851
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:04,413
People used to say,
"The United States are"

852
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:09,793
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is"

853
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:16,193
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

854
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:18,430
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

855
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:20,996
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

856
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,404
With his life.

857
00:59:24,878 --> 00:59:28,871
So how am I gonna get him alone?

858
00:59:32,586 --> 00:59:33,848
I'm gonna kidnap him.

859
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,481
I'm gonna kidnap
the President of the United States.

860
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,255
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

861
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:47,562
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

862
00:59:47,634 --> 00:59:49,625
Are you out of your mind?

863
00:59:49,703 --> 00:59:52,763
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

864
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,239
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

865
00:59:56,576 --> 00:59:58,278
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

866
00:59:58,278 --> 00:59:59,472
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

867
00:59:59,546 --> 01:00:01,741
- What?
- I'm in.

868
01:00:01,915 --> 01:00:04,679
Sir, we have to move the party.

869
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:07,651
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

870
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:10,212
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

871
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:13,748
- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.

872
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:17,923
They want a quote on, "Is the President
being insensitive to minority issues?"

873
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:21,126
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

874
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,863
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

875
01:00:23,937 --> 01:00:27,634
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

876
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:32,735
- I... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

877
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:35,577
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

878
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:37,913
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

879
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:41,351
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

880
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:45,585
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

881
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:48,856
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

882
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:51,124
Book it before someone else does.

883
01:00:55,836 --> 01:00:58,430
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

884
01:00:58,538 --> 01:01:00,836
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.

885
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,163
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

886
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,902
Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?

887
01:01:35,976 --> 01:01:38,501
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.

888
01:01:38,578 --> 01:01:42,014
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

889
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:50,220
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

890
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,885
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

891
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,829
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

892
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:03,970
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

893
01:02:11,378 --> 01:02:15,075
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.

894
01:02:24,858 --> 01:02:27,759
Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.

895
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,387
- All clear. Perimeter secure.
- Hey.

896
01:02:30,463 --> 01:02:33,796
You didn't happen to see
a cute brunette wandering around?

897
01:02:33,867 --> 01:02:36,961
- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.

898
01:02:37,704 --> 01:02:39,194
I've got no game tonight.

899
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:50,108
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

900
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:54,210
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.

901
01:02:54,287 --> 01:02:58,417
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the President's birth...

902
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,083
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

903
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:03,857
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

904
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:07,195
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

905
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:11,601
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

906
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:15,539
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.

907
01:03:15,609 --> 01:03:16,940
Sir?

908
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,069
Considering your discovered lineage.

909
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:21,670
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.

910
01:03:21,748 --> 01:03:24,945
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

911
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:29,011
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

912
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:30,647
Have a look at that.

913
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:34,319
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

914
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:37,261
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.

915
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:41,096
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

916
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,964
It belonged to my great uncle.

917
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:45,163
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

918
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,537
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

919
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:52,169
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.

920
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:55,612
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

921
01:03:55,682 --> 01:03:59,948
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.

922
01:04:00,053 --> 01:04:03,682
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.

923
01:04:04,691 --> 01:04:06,852
- Well...

924
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,623
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

925
01:04:11,398 --> 01:04:12,922
Are we allowed to do that?

926
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,701
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the President.

927
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,032
Can I come with you?

928
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:22,335
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

929
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:24,934
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.

930
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:28,810
According to this map, it should be...

931
01:04:29,883 --> 01:04:33,876
It's one... two. ln here.

932
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,580
Yeah, should be in here.

933
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:38,619
- May l?
- Absolutely.

934
01:04:38,692 --> 01:04:40,182
All right.

935
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:46,999
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,

936
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:49,058
but I have no enemies down here.

937
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:52,895
ln the cellar. ln this tiny little room.

938
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:55,674
I'll just wait here, then.

939
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:08,143
Over here.

940
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:15,426
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.

941
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:19,056
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.

942
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:25,835
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.

943
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:33,239
OK, what else?

944
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,080
The arrowhead...

945
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:40,348
...is sideways.

946
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:50,153
We're all right.
Don't worry.

947
01:05:55,568 --> 01:05:56,865
Look at that.

948
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:58,659
Come on.

949
01:06:04,911 --> 01:06:05,900
Mr. President?

950
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,040
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...

951
01:06:12,152 --> 01:06:16,452
- lnform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!

952
01:06:17,123 --> 01:06:20,092
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

953
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,891
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer

954
01:06:23,963 --> 01:06:26,761
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!

955
01:06:27,534 --> 01:06:31,026
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!

956
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,563
Tom, alert the Vice President.

957
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:38,369
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

958
01:06:38,445 --> 01:06:41,539
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

959
01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:46,108
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

960
01:06:46,186 --> 01:06:49,952
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

961
01:06:50,023 --> 01:06:54,790
A treasure map to Cibola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

962
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:57,193
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

963
01:06:57,297 --> 01:07:00,664
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

964
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,966
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

965
01:07:05,038 --> 01:07:06,562
You've been in my desk too?

966
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:09,699
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

967
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:12,568
...in the President's Book, sir.

968
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:17,574
The book known only to our presidents.

969
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:21,176
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

970
01:07:25,992 --> 01:07:28,722
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

971
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:34,665
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.

972
01:07:36,236 --> 01:07:38,727
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here

973
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:42,172
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,

974
01:07:42,242 --> 01:07:44,073
and I'll show you.

975
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,202
You don't negotiate very well, do you?

976
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:48,475
No, sir.

977
01:07:49,115 --> 01:07:50,275
Mr. President!

978
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,045
Where are my sledgehammers?

979
01:07:57,924 --> 01:07:59,186
I don't get you, Gates.

980
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,089
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

981
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,459
just to clear your ancestor's name.

982
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,598
The way out is just down those stairs.

983
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:11,770
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

984
01:08:12,572 --> 01:08:15,336
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

985
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:18,002
to his country to stop the KGC.

986
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:21,877
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honored.

987
01:08:21,948 --> 01:08:23,813
"Last full measure of devotion"?

988
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:27,351
Lincoln is my favorite president, sir.
No offense.

989
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:31,921
None taken. He's my favorite too.

990
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:36,923
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

991
01:08:36,996 --> 01:08:40,363
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

992
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,696
Even if something like that
really did exist,

993
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:46,671
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

994
01:08:47,273 --> 01:08:49,138
Because it will probably lead us

995
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:53,304
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

996
01:08:53,947 --> 01:08:56,939
A huge piece of culture lost.

997
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,110
You can give that history
back to its descendants.

998
01:09:00,153 --> 01:09:04,351
And because you're the President
of the United States, sir.

999
01:09:04,424 --> 01:09:09,293
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

1000
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:12,263
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

1001
01:09:12,932 --> 01:09:15,867
I believe you
to be an honorable man, sir.

1002
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,270
People don't believe that stuff anymore.

1003
01:09:22,275 --> 01:09:23,799
They want to believe it.

1004
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:50,834
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.

1005
01:09:55,808 --> 01:09:58,208
- Gates.
- Sir?

1006
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:01,337
The following conversation
never happened.

1007
01:10:02,715 --> 01:10:04,182
The book exists.

1008
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:07,785
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?

1009
01:10:07,854 --> 01:10:09,685
ln the Library of Congress.

1010
01:10:10,423 --> 01:10:15,122
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.

1011
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,485
Thank you, sir.

1012
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:22,366
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.

1013
01:10:22,435 --> 01:10:23,732
Got it.

1014
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:28,433
- And, Gates...
- Sir?

1015
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:33,810
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.

1016
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,212
Unless you find what you're looking for,

1017
01:10:36,282 --> 01:10:39,080
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the President.

1018
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:43,521
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

1019
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:51,056
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.

1020
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:55,958
Page 47. Just have a look at that.

1021
01:10:59,205 --> 01:11:02,402
Riley, meet me at the
Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

1022
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:06,100
OK.

1023
01:11:13,386 --> 01:11:14,375
Sadusky.

1024
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:19,925
The President's been... what?

1025
01:11:22,295 --> 01:11:23,284
Gates.

1026
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,892
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1027
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:35,373
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1028
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:37,068
- Hey.
- Hey.

1029
01:11:37,477 --> 01:11:38,842
We're close.

1030
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:52,413
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.

1031
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:55,984
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.

1032
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:59,031
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.

1033
01:12:21,988 --> 01:12:22,977
This will be good.

1034
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,416
Here we go. XA... XM...

1035
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,868
Look. Do you have a code?

1036
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:40,002
Three-seven-nine-four.

1037
01:12:46,746 --> 01:12:49,044
What did the President say
the number was?

1038
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,310
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

1039
01:12:59,392 --> 01:13:01,417
Two-three-six-seven...

1040
01:13:01,494 --> 01:13:04,554
X-Y-two-three-three,
two-three-seven-eight... Here.

1041
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,291
Two-three-four-seven-nine-one.

1042
01:13:06,432 --> 01:13:09,265
- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, seventy-eight...

1043
01:13:09,335 --> 01:13:10,632
It's not there.

1044
01:13:12,572 --> 01:13:15,234
Maybe someone checked it out.

1045
01:13:16,876 --> 01:13:21,040
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.

1046
01:13:30,857 --> 01:13:31,846
Here.

1047
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:51,274
- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.

1048
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:55,246
The location is the combination.

1049
01:13:56,582 --> 01:13:58,379
The location is the combination.

1050
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,502
Yes. I was right.

1051
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:19,803
Well done, Mr. Poole.

1052
01:14:26,979 --> 01:14:28,571
Eagle and the scroll.

1053
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,884
- Area 51!
- Shh!

1054
01:14:46,032 --> 01:14:48,523
- Kennedy assassination.
- Shh! We don't have time.

1055
01:14:48,601 --> 01:14:50,626
Yeah, it's true.

1056
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,301
Here. Wait.

1057
01:14:56,375 --> 01:15:00,539
"April 1865. Queen Victoria
sends Pike two coded missives.

1058
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:05,083
The first is received.
Contains information regarding

1059
01:15:05,117 --> 01:15:08,553
New World treasure. The City of Gold"

1060
01:15:09,155 --> 01:15:12,522
Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?

1061
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:16,220
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.

1062
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:19,458
"The second missive was thought
to contain a Playfair cipher

1063
01:15:19,532 --> 01:15:23,468
suggesting contact with Laboulaye,
who'll hide clues before his death"

1064
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:27,267
The cipher written into the Booth
diary page that Thomas tried to burn.

1065
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,638
- The one we have.
- Exactly. "1880.

1066
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:34,607
Resolute desk arrives in Washington,
sent by queen to President Hayes"

1067
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:37,638
Look at that.

1068
01:15:39,418 --> 01:15:42,683
Missing plank from the White House. Wow.

1069
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:47,217
Here's the final entry
by President Coolidge.

1070
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:51,354
"1924. I found a plank
in secret desk compartment.

1071
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:55,127
Plank photographed and then destroyed.

1072
01:15:55,201 --> 01:15:57,999
Borglum commissioned
to destroy landmarks

1073
01:15:58,104 --> 01:16:00,197
in sacred Black Hills mountains"

1074
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:06,437
Borglum. Mount Rushmore?

1075
01:16:07,113 --> 01:16:12,107
He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks

1076
01:16:12,184 --> 01:16:14,652
in order to protect the City of Gold.

1077
01:16:15,688 --> 01:16:18,316
Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.

1078
01:16:18,391 --> 01:16:21,155
- What is it?

1079
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:26,129
There's my tax dollars at work,
coming to arrest me.

1080
01:16:26,198 --> 01:16:28,826
Not coming for you,
they're for me. Go to the car.

1081
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:30,801
- No!
- Go! I'll meet up with you.

1082
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:32,359
This way.

1083
01:16:41,213 --> 01:16:43,613
So Gates abducts the President,
lets him go

1084
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,673
and heads to the Library of Congress?

1085
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:48,379
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to check out a book.

1086
01:17:07,807 --> 01:17:09,365
This way.

1087
01:17:30,262 --> 01:17:32,730
All agents...

1088
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:47,275
- Dad.
- Ben.

1089
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:49,610
Get out of there.
I had to move the car.

1090
01:17:49,682 --> 01:17:52,082
FBl, Secret Service all over the place.

1091
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:54,915
Calm down. I sent a picture
of the plank to your cell.

1092
01:17:54,987 --> 01:17:56,921
- You can do that?
- Yes, I can do that.

1093
01:17:57,022 --> 01:17:58,649
did you get it?

1094
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:00,789
- I got it.
- Look.

1095
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:06,556
- Take it to Mom for translation.
- Why me?

1096
01:18:06,632 --> 01:18:08,691
He say his mom
could translate the plank?

1097
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,667
Find out who she is.

1098
01:18:21,881 --> 01:18:24,611
- How are we going to find Ben?
- I don't know.

1099
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:26,583
- Hold it! Who are you?
- We work here.

1100
01:18:26,652 --> 01:18:28,847
- lDs.
- Here. We were told to evacuate.

1101
01:18:28,921 --> 01:18:30,616
I don't know what's going on.

1102
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:33,283
- My car's parked...
- One second I'm reading...

1103
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:36,851
- Special section for...
- ...a book, then we're rushed out...

1104
01:18:36,929 --> 01:18:38,487
- Go ahead.
- OK. Thank you.

1105
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:41,658
- Thank you for your help, officer.
- Best of luck.

1106
01:18:42,168 --> 01:18:44,966
- Have a good night.

1107
01:18:48,574 --> 01:18:51,805
Hey, go
to the northeast sectors...

1108
01:18:55,281 --> 01:18:56,612
Start the car.

1109
01:18:59,685 --> 01:19:00,845
Put it in gear.

1110
01:19:02,855 --> 01:19:04,789
- Uh-oh.
- What's the problem?

1111
01:19:04,857 --> 01:19:05,983
It's clear. Let's go!

1112
01:19:06,592 --> 01:19:07,889
We're going to jail.

1113
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,759
I want to run a check...

1114
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:16,965
Get in! Hang on!

1115
01:19:18,571 --> 01:19:19,799
Mercedes SUV...

1116
01:19:19,872 --> 01:19:22,432
- He's in! Go!
- Hang on!

1117
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,135
Whoa!

1118
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:26,503
OK. We can do this.

1119
01:19:30,716 --> 01:19:32,843
Close the barricade, lock it down!

1120
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:35,011
Lock it down!

1121
01:19:37,723 --> 01:19:39,554
- Drive, drive, drive!
- OK.

1122
01:19:41,727 --> 01:19:43,388
I don't think so!

1123
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:45,324
Whoa, whoa!

1124
01:19:49,768 --> 01:19:52,100
Go, go, go, go, go!

1125
01:19:52,171 --> 01:19:54,435
Let's go! Let's go!

1126
01:19:57,009 --> 01:19:59,500
That did not turn out
the way it was supposed to!

1127
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:02,240
- How'd they find us so quick?
- I'll tell you how.

1128
01:20:02,314 --> 01:20:05,977
- The President is a tattletale!
- Sadusky. He was there.

1129
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,383
He knows more about the book
than I thought.

1130
01:20:08,454 --> 01:20:11,055
How'd the President
feel about being kidnapped?

1131
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:12,816
He was OK.

1132
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:22,168
- Dr. Appleton.
- This office is closed. I'm sorry.

1133
01:20:22,236 --> 01:20:24,704
I do apologize
for the lateness of the hour.

1134
01:20:26,073 --> 01:20:28,268
My name is Mitch Wilkinson.

1135
01:20:28,342 --> 01:20:31,971
I've got something I want you
to take a look at. Just take a minute.

1136
01:20:39,753 --> 01:20:42,051
- You're a treasure hunter.
- No, ma'am.

1137
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:44,886
I'm just a man trying
to make his mark on history.

1138
01:20:45,426 --> 01:20:46,757
Can you help me?

1139
01:20:48,162 --> 01:20:52,428
Um... No, I don't know that language.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1140
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:55,058
- Oh, excuse me.

1141
01:20:58,205 --> 01:20:59,297
Yes.

1142
01:21:00,908 --> 01:21:02,375
Got it.

1143
01:21:02,977 --> 01:21:06,743
Your ex-husband's on his way up.
He wants the translation.

1144
01:21:08,182 --> 01:21:13,347
Tell him anything but the truth.
Get rid of him. His life depends on it.

1145
01:21:22,997 --> 01:21:24,555
Emily?

1146
01:21:37,278 --> 01:21:39,508
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

1147
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:44,847
and I'm not comfortable either,
but we need you to translate something.

1148
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:50,852
- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.

1149
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,150
If it's for Ben, of course. What is it?

1150
01:21:55,229 --> 01:21:57,561
Oh. Uh...

1151
01:21:57,631 --> 01:22:00,395
It's in the cell phone.
I'm not sure how to...

1152
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:02,458
- Give it to me.
- ...bring it out.

1153
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:12,744
We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.

1154
01:22:16,817 --> 01:22:20,014
Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass"

1155
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:24,717
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1156
01:22:25,426 --> 01:22:26,415
Right.

1157
01:22:29,697 --> 01:22:34,100
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird"

1158
01:22:38,672 --> 01:22:39,730
That's it?

1159
01:22:47,348 --> 01:22:51,682
Did it ever occur to you...?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1160
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:56,822
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

1161
01:22:59,593 --> 01:23:03,461
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

1162
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:06,863
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

1163
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:08,925
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1164
01:23:09,803 --> 01:23:14,263
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

1165
01:23:16,877 --> 01:23:18,435
No, of course not.

1166
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,743
So just go away.

1167
01:23:34,828 --> 01:23:36,318
Lousy tequila.

1168
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:43,131
Don't feel bad. You did good.

1169
01:23:43,203 --> 01:23:45,262
Patrick believed every word you said.

1170
01:23:45,339 --> 01:23:48,900
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

1171
01:23:48,976 --> 01:23:50,807
You don't know Benjamin.

1172
01:23:50,878 --> 01:23:54,439
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

1173
01:23:58,085 --> 01:24:02,954
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

1174
01:24:03,023 --> 01:24:07,289
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

1175
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:10,930
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

1176
01:24:11,765 --> 01:24:16,065
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

1177
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:22,006
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

1178
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:25,273
It's ironic, isn't it?

1179
01:24:25,345 --> 01:24:30,112
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

1180
01:24:30,184 --> 01:24:33,711
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

1181
01:24:34,555 --> 01:24:36,284
Making me the only one...

1182
01:24:37,491 --> 01:24:38,192
...who can find Cibola.

1183
01:24:38,192 --> 01:24:38,988
...who can find Cibola.

1184
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:42,319
Get your coat.

1185
01:24:55,209 --> 01:24:58,201
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

1186
01:24:58,278 --> 01:25:01,839
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

1187
01:25:02,249 --> 01:25:03,511
I don't think so.

1188
01:25:11,325 --> 01:25:13,156
How do I get to, um, this...

1189
01:25:15,028 --> 01:25:16,256
Hello, Mitch.

1190
01:25:17,931 --> 01:25:18,989
Mom...

1191
01:25:19,066 --> 01:25:21,933
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

1192
01:25:22,269 --> 01:25:25,261
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

1193
01:25:25,672 --> 01:25:28,641
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1194
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:32,440
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

1195
01:25:32,513 --> 01:25:36,779
I kidnapped the President. The FBl
is on their way right now to arrest me,

1196
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:38,875
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1197
01:25:38,952 --> 01:25:41,079
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1198
01:25:41,155 --> 01:25:43,885
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

1199
01:25:44,124 --> 01:25:47,025
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

1200
01:25:47,094 --> 01:25:49,460
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

1201
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:52,397
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

1202
01:25:55,469 --> 01:25:56,936
I'm afraid he's burned it.

1203
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:04,939
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

1204
01:26:05,579 --> 01:26:08,912
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

1205
01:26:08,982 --> 01:26:12,213
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

1206
01:26:12,286 --> 01:26:14,186
- What?
- I'm going with you.

1207
01:26:14,254 --> 01:26:18,020
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

1208
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:19,353
it's going to be me.

1209
01:26:19,426 --> 01:26:22,520
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

1210
01:26:22,596 --> 01:26:24,257
What makes you think I'd agree?

1211
01:26:25,165 --> 01:26:29,693
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

1212
01:26:34,274 --> 01:26:36,504
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1213
01:26:39,413 --> 01:26:43,281
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

1214
01:26:48,222 --> 01:26:52,022
- Which president? The President?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

1215
01:27:05,339 --> 01:27:09,002
I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

1216
01:27:10,944 --> 01:27:12,912
All right. Let's have it.

1217
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:17,417
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

1218
01:27:17,484 --> 01:27:22,786
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain"

1219
01:27:22,856 --> 01:27:24,448
Figure that one out.

1220
01:27:24,524 --> 01:27:28,153
So we come back when it's raining?

1221
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:33,997
"Cloudless" Could simply mean the sun.

1222
01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:37,660
You need a sunny day... and rain.

1223
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:40,028
We need water.

1224
01:27:40,774 --> 01:27:41,934
Water.

1225
01:27:52,586 --> 01:27:53,712
Abigail.

1226
01:27:54,888 --> 01:27:58,324
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

1227
01:27:58,392 --> 01:27:59,620
Em? Water?

1228
01:27:59,693 --> 01:28:03,789
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.

1229
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:19,073
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

1230
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:30,189
That's it.

1231
01:28:30,257 --> 01:28:34,853
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

1232
01:28:37,064 --> 01:28:38,190
Look at this!

1233
01:28:39,733 --> 01:28:40,791
It's an eagle.

1234
01:28:42,769 --> 01:28:45,397
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

1235
01:28:45,839 --> 01:28:48,637
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage"

1236
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:52,201
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

1237
01:28:52,312 --> 01:28:57,181
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

1238
01:28:58,318 --> 01:29:01,845
- It indicates direction...
- Somehow that bird...

1239
01:29:01,922 --> 01:29:05,756
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

1240
01:29:05,826 --> 01:29:10,058
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

1241
01:29:11,331 --> 01:29:14,232
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior"

1242
01:29:15,769 --> 01:29:18,101
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

1243
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:25,705
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

1244
01:29:25,779 --> 01:29:28,475
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

1245
01:29:28,548 --> 01:29:30,106
It's a horrible trap.

1246
01:29:30,183 --> 01:29:33,812
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

1247
01:29:35,155 --> 01:29:36,520
I'll do it, Ben.

1248
01:29:37,157 --> 01:29:38,146
It's OK.

1249
01:29:42,696 --> 01:29:44,561
Surrender your hand.

1250
01:30:01,581 --> 01:30:04,675
- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!

1251
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,378
It, uh... feels like a latch.

1252
01:30:19,733 --> 01:30:20,927
Look at this.

1253
01:30:32,879 --> 01:30:35,609
All right, good. Let's go.

1254
01:30:56,002 --> 01:30:57,594
Oh!

1255
01:31:01,942 --> 01:31:03,409
Ben, look at this.

1256
01:31:04,311 --> 01:31:06,472
Oh, that's beautiful!

1257
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:13,310
- Patrick. Patrick!
- Ben, what is that?

1258
01:31:13,386 --> 01:31:16,378
Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.

1259
01:31:16,456 --> 01:31:18,549
- What is that sound?

1260
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:19,956
Fascinating.

1261
01:31:23,597 --> 01:31:25,792
- Ah!

1262
01:31:25,866 --> 01:31:26,924
Ben!

1263
01:31:37,377 --> 01:31:38,674
Sorry.

1264
01:31:38,745 --> 01:31:40,337
- You OK?
- No.

1265
01:31:40,814 --> 01:31:41,803
Get up.

1266
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,639
It's locked.

1267
01:31:44,718 --> 01:31:49,485
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

1268
01:31:49,556 --> 01:31:51,524
Only one way out of here now.

1269
01:31:53,593 --> 01:31:54,821
Forward.

1270
01:31:59,533 --> 01:32:02,502
Oh!

1271
01:32:07,374 --> 01:32:09,808
Never seen so many relics.

1272
01:32:09,876 --> 01:32:11,969
So beautifully preserved.

1273
01:32:15,315 --> 01:32:17,977
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.

1274
01:32:18,051 --> 01:32:21,487
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.

1275
01:32:24,524 --> 01:32:26,048
It's a little golden man.

1276
01:32:28,662 --> 01:32:33,497
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...

1277
01:32:46,646 --> 01:32:48,443
- Ben!
- Ben!

1278
01:32:54,187 --> 01:32:57,452
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!

1279
01:33:00,393 --> 01:33:01,519
Back up! Back up!

1280
01:33:02,362 --> 01:33:03,522
Ah!

1281
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:09,869
Riley, move forward! Move forward!

1282
01:33:11,004 --> 01:33:12,471
No, back up, back up.

1283
01:33:14,641 --> 01:33:16,700
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

1284
01:33:20,413 --> 01:33:24,110
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

1285
01:33:27,287 --> 01:33:29,346
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

1286
01:33:29,422 --> 01:33:32,152
Figure something out.
Tell you what we're going to do.

1287
01:33:32,225 --> 01:33:34,591
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!

1288
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:37,494
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.

1289
01:33:37,564 --> 01:33:41,830
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.

1290
01:33:41,901 --> 01:33:44,028
That is a good idea.

1291
01:33:47,574 --> 01:33:50,702
There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.

1292
01:33:54,614 --> 01:33:57,082
Ben, look!
There's a ladder.

1293
01:33:57,150 --> 01:34:01,211
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.

1294
01:34:03,723 --> 01:34:07,625
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait. Just...

1295
01:34:07,694 --> 01:34:10,822
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.

1296
01:34:12,999 --> 01:34:14,466
One step at a time. Good.

1297
01:34:18,838 --> 01:34:21,966
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.

1298
01:34:25,545 --> 01:34:27,775
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!

1299
01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:29,906
I can get up there just as easy as you.

1300
01:34:32,152 --> 01:34:33,141
Just stop.

1301
01:34:34,621 --> 01:34:36,782
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.

1302
01:34:36,856 --> 01:34:40,519
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.

1303
01:34:41,895 --> 01:34:42,884
Look!

1304
01:34:45,765 --> 01:34:47,357
What's it gonna be?

1305
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,573
We'll do this your way.

1306
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:16,493
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.

1307
01:35:16,563 --> 01:35:18,053
One step at a time.

1308
01:35:18,898 --> 01:35:21,924
One, two, three.

1309
01:35:41,254 --> 01:35:42,881
- You ready?
- Go.

1310
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:55,490
Ah!

1311
01:36:16,756 --> 01:36:18,747
Mitch, what do you see?

1312
01:36:20,059 --> 01:36:21,617
Is there a way out?

1313
01:36:23,229 --> 01:36:24,753
What's up there, Mitch?

1314
01:36:36,609 --> 01:36:37,769
Em?

1315
01:36:37,844 --> 01:36:43,282
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

1316
01:36:47,921 --> 01:36:49,013
All right.

1317
01:36:50,824 --> 01:36:51,950
Let's go.

1318
01:36:52,959 --> 01:36:55,427
Mitch! Come on!

1319
01:36:56,196 --> 01:36:58,892
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.

1320
01:36:59,332 --> 01:37:01,766
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.

1321
01:37:01,835 --> 01:37:03,962
Promise you'll
come back for me.

1322
01:37:04,037 --> 01:37:05,766
I can do the math too.

1323
01:37:07,173 --> 01:37:09,835
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.

1324
01:37:11,544 --> 01:37:16,038
"No, we'll figure something else out"
"We need you there. Please, Riley"

1325
01:37:17,784 --> 01:37:18,944
I'm just kidding. Go.

1326
01:37:19,452 --> 01:37:21,010
OK...

1327
01:37:49,949 --> 01:37:54,613
- One... two... three!
- Go!

1328
01:37:59,759 --> 01:38:01,124
Oh!

1329
01:38:01,761 --> 01:38:03,854
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1330
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,488
Uh!

1331
01:38:09,435 --> 01:38:10,459
I can't get it.

1332
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:19,501
Just go! Go now! Go!

1333
01:38:22,015 --> 01:38:23,880
- All right, ready?
- Now!

1334
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:26,145
Ah!

1335
01:38:26,219 --> 01:38:27,982
Riley! Hang on!

1336
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:35,518
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!

1337
01:38:35,595 --> 01:38:38,291
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!

1338
01:38:38,364 --> 01:38:39,729
Then roll it!

1339
01:38:43,036 --> 01:38:44,025
Here it comes!

1340
01:38:52,879 --> 01:38:54,278
Come on, Ben!

1341
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,879
Here! Give me your hand!

1342
01:39:01,287 --> 01:39:02,777
Ben!

1343
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:05,048
Thanks, Riley.

1344
01:39:08,328 --> 01:39:10,193
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?

1345
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:18,000
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

1346
01:39:20,306 --> 01:39:22,501
So... forward.

1347
01:39:26,045 --> 01:39:29,208
- What is this?

1348
01:39:29,282 --> 01:39:32,080
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1349
01:39:33,653 --> 01:39:34,881
Oh!

1350
01:39:39,626 --> 01:39:41,457
Put your light over there.

1351
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:45,897
What are you doing?

1352
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:14,426
I can't see anything!
Is this it?

1353
01:40:19,932 --> 01:40:20,921
It's oil!

1354
01:41:00,039 --> 01:41:03,440
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!

1355
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:05,577
We have to turn back!

1356
01:41:15,188 --> 01:41:16,519
OK.

1357
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:22,117
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

1358
01:41:24,997 --> 01:41:25,986
OK.

1359
01:41:31,137 --> 01:41:32,365
I got it!

1360
01:41:34,574 --> 01:41:37,134
I got you! I got you!

1361
01:42:06,038 --> 01:42:07,596
There's no forward!

1362
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:12,805
It's not forward, it's down!

1363
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:18,308
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

1364
01:42:28,694 --> 01:42:30,685
Help me turn this wheel!

1365
01:43:03,963 --> 01:43:05,828
The water's going down.

1366
01:43:55,948 --> 01:43:57,643
It is... Em.

1367
01:43:58,751 --> 01:44:00,742
Em. Em.

1368
01:44:06,959 --> 01:44:08,790
Ben! Hey!

1369
01:44:08,861 --> 01:44:13,161
Dad! We found it!

1370
01:44:13,532 --> 01:44:17,093
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!

1371
01:44:22,475 --> 01:44:25,740
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.

1372
01:44:25,811 --> 01:44:28,371
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.

1373
01:44:28,447 --> 01:44:33,214
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,

1374
01:44:33,286 --> 01:44:37,222
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.

1375
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:11,353
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.

1376
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:13,790
She was frantic. She was frantic.

1377
01:45:14,794 --> 01:45:18,195
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see...?

1378
01:45:18,264 --> 01:45:22,200
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?

1379
01:45:22,268 --> 01:45:26,261
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.

1380
01:45:26,772 --> 01:45:28,296
Where's your mother going?

1381
01:45:31,043 --> 01:45:34,240
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.

1382
01:45:34,313 --> 01:45:35,405
- What?
- Look.

1383
01:45:35,481 --> 01:45:37,881
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.

1384
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:41,579
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.

1385
01:45:41,654 --> 01:45:43,485
Oh!

1386
01:45:43,556 --> 01:45:45,319
Em?

1387
01:45:45,391 --> 01:45:47,985
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.

1388
01:45:48,961 --> 01:45:51,953
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.

1389
01:45:52,498 --> 01:45:55,331
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.

1390
01:46:12,752 --> 01:46:15,744
- What was that?
- Listen.

1391
01:46:35,775 --> 01:46:37,538
Ah!

1392
01:46:41,881 --> 01:46:45,544
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!

1393
01:46:45,618 --> 01:46:49,076
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

1394
01:46:56,595 --> 01:46:58,495
Ben, there's a current!

1395
01:46:58,931 --> 01:47:01,991
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!

1396
01:47:02,068 --> 01:47:04,161
It's under us. Right here!

1397
01:47:13,412 --> 01:47:14,401
Come on!

1398
01:47:15,848 --> 01:47:17,839
Let's go! Get in there!

1399
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:26,983
The water's rising too fast!

1400
01:47:27,059 --> 01:47:29,789
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!

1401
01:47:46,512 --> 01:47:49,675
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.

1402
01:47:50,249 --> 01:47:52,513
It fills with water
when you open the door!

1403
01:47:52,618 --> 01:47:55,746
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!

1404
01:47:55,788 --> 01:47:58,814
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

1405
01:47:58,891 --> 01:48:01,587
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

1406
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,389
Patrick, Emily, go!

1407
01:48:08,767 --> 01:48:09,825
- No.
- No!

1408
01:48:11,403 --> 01:48:12,392
No!

1409
01:48:12,471 --> 01:48:15,235
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

1410
01:48:15,774 --> 01:48:17,571
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

1411
01:48:19,044 --> 01:48:21,638
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

1412
01:48:21,714 --> 01:48:23,944
We both know what has to happen here.

1413
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:27,851
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

1414
01:48:29,822 --> 01:48:30,914
I vote Mitch.

1415
01:48:31,991 --> 01:48:33,925
This isn't a democracy.

1416
01:48:38,564 --> 01:48:42,523
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

1417
01:48:43,469 --> 01:48:45,960
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

1418
01:48:46,038 --> 01:48:48,768
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

1419
01:48:48,841 --> 01:48:53,107
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

1420
01:48:53,212 --> 01:48:55,612
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

1421
01:48:55,648 --> 01:48:59,550
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

1422
01:49:01,453 --> 01:49:04,945
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

1423
01:49:08,994 --> 01:49:11,622
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1424
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:14,588
Abigail.

1425
01:49:18,704 --> 01:49:22,435
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

1426
01:49:31,784 --> 01:49:33,046
- No!
- Let's go!

1427
01:49:33,552 --> 01:49:37,511
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

1428
01:49:38,257 --> 01:49:39,884
Please, come on.

1429
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:43,054
Push, Ben!

1430
01:49:46,732 --> 01:49:48,666
The current's too strong!

1431
01:49:51,904 --> 01:49:54,099
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

1432
01:50:10,089 --> 01:50:11,078
Ah!

1433
01:50:17,162 --> 01:50:18,322
Mom!

1434
01:50:18,897 --> 01:50:21,127
- Hang on!

1435
01:50:23,969 --> 01:50:25,231
Hold your breath!

1436
01:50:35,014 --> 01:50:36,845
Ah!

1437
01:50:36,915 --> 01:50:38,644
We got to get Ben out of there!

1438
01:50:41,687 --> 01:50:45,987
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

1439
01:50:46,058 --> 01:50:48,993
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

1440
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:53,191
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

1441
01:50:53,299 --> 01:50:55,824
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

1442
01:50:55,868 --> 01:50:57,233
I'll get you out!

1443
01:50:57,303 --> 01:51:01,672
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

1444
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:03,731
And no one will ever know?

1445
01:51:03,809 --> 01:51:08,041
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

1446
01:51:08,113 --> 01:51:11,674
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

1447
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:14,913
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

1448
01:51:15,754 --> 01:51:19,212
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

1449
01:51:20,726 --> 01:51:22,853
- Mitch!

1450
01:51:32,004 --> 01:51:33,062
Ah!

1451
01:52:03,335 --> 01:52:04,461
Thank you.

1452
01:52:21,987 --> 01:52:25,946
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
Oh, hi.

1453
01:52:32,197 --> 01:52:34,757
Sir! It's for you.

1454
01:52:36,068 --> 01:52:37,057
Sadusky.

1455
01:52:38,003 --> 01:52:40,801
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

1456
01:52:41,206 --> 01:52:45,074
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

1457
01:52:45,144 --> 01:52:48,807
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

1458
01:52:48,881 --> 01:52:51,679
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

1459
01:53:12,171 --> 01:53:14,765
Stop. Stop it.

1460
01:53:15,874 --> 01:53:18,206
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

1461
01:53:18,277 --> 01:53:22,043
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

1462
01:53:22,114 --> 01:53:24,878
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

1463
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:28,511
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

1464
01:53:28,854 --> 01:53:30,048
Yes, sir.

1465
01:53:32,257 --> 01:53:34,020
- Gates.
- Sir.

1466
01:53:35,093 --> 01:53:39,655
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

1467
01:53:39,731 --> 01:53:43,258
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.

1468
01:53:44,803 --> 01:53:47,738
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

1469
01:53:48,273 --> 01:53:50,935
- Thank you.
- Craig.

1470
01:53:52,277 --> 01:53:56,543
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1471
01:53:58,116 --> 01:53:59,105
Tomorrow?

1472
01:54:07,326 --> 01:54:08,588
Thank you, sir.

1473
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:12,029
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

1474
01:54:12,097 --> 01:54:14,190
will get credit for this discovery.

1475
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:23,706
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1476
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:28,444
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

1477
01:54:30,048 --> 01:54:33,040
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.

1478
01:54:34,586 --> 01:54:37,020
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

1479
01:54:37,089 --> 01:54:39,284
I believe I can help with that, sir.

1480
01:54:39,358 --> 01:54:42,555
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

1481
01:54:46,231 --> 01:54:49,860
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

1482
01:54:53,105 --> 01:54:54,231
What book?

1483
01:54:55,807 --> 01:54:59,868
Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

1484
01:54:59,945 --> 01:55:02,209
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

1485
01:55:02,281 --> 01:55:03,646
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

1486
01:55:03,715 --> 01:55:06,775
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

1487
01:55:06,852 --> 01:55:10,151
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

1488
01:55:14,126 --> 01:55:15,559
Excuse me.

1489
01:55:15,627 --> 01:55:19,529
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

1490
01:55:19,598 --> 01:55:23,432
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

1491
01:55:23,502 --> 01:55:27,939
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.

1492
01:55:28,607 --> 01:55:30,598
- Will you sign it?

1493
01:55:30,676 --> 01:55:31,665
OK.

1494
01:55:40,919 --> 01:55:41,908
Thank you.

1495
01:55:43,255 --> 01:55:46,486
So, um, the tea tables...

1496
01:55:47,492 --> 01:55:51,223
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

1497
01:55:52,197 --> 01:55:54,131
I was going to say
you can keep them.

1498
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,130
And maybe you could...

1499
01:55:59,204 --> 01:56:01,502
...come and move back in with me.

1500
01:56:02,674 --> 01:56:05,472
- No. You used the word "so"
- So?

1501
01:56:05,544 --> 01:56:07,978
So, when you say "so"
it means you're angry.

1502
01:56:08,046 --> 01:56:12,005
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

1503
01:56:12,084 --> 01:56:14,416
It's sort of like a puzzle.

1504
01:56:15,954 --> 01:56:19,617
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1505
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,354
So...

1506
01:57:10,142 --> 01:57:11,769
I love this car.
